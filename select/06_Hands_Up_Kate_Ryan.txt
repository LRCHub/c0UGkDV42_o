The first time I saw you I still remember when you passed me by
Love at first sight that day in September when I was so shy

The way you smiled, it turned me around - You spin my life upside down
And for a while time stood still - 'Cause I couldn't believe this was real

Chorus
So put your hands up in the sky
C'mon and celebrate our love tonight
Yea put your hands up right into mine
'Cause baby love reigns divine

The first time I kissed you I still remember, I gave all I had
(We were) out of control that night in September
Yea we were bad

The way we held each other so tight - You made me shiver in sheer delight
I felt the earth move as time stood still - No I couldn't believe this was real

Chorus

Yea put your hands up in the sky - C'mon and celebrate our love tonight
You gotta live one day at a time - 'Cause baby love reigns divine
